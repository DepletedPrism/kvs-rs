A simple key-value database written in Rust. It is essentially based on the
[TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/courses/rust/README.md)
section of the [Talent Plan](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan) initiated
by PingCAP. The progress does not cover the entire course content, and further
progress may be made after completing all projects.
